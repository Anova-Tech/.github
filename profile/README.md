## About Anova Financial Networks

Anova Financial Networks is the only global carrier offering wireless and fiber connectivity as well as market data distribution across all asset classes. Since 2009 when Anova first launched, technology has been at the core of our DNA. Through innovative network engineering, proprietary products and green-field builds, we overcome technical challenges time and time again.

Since then, Anova has become far more than an engineering firm. The depth of first-rate fiber and wireless assets that we’ve built and acquired, the global reach of our network and our client-centric focus have redefined how a carrier can serve the business objectives of the financial industry.

## Our Mission

A central pillar of Anova’s mission is to provide wireless market data to financial firms of all sizes. Our vision is to increase worldwide price transparency and market efficiency for Anova clients, as well as for their institutional and retail customers.

Over time, the demand for latency-critical wireless circuits and wireless market data has progressed from the initial cutting-edge early adopters to widespread acceptance by most financial market participants with less sensitivity to latency. Today, Anova ensures that the entire financial industry has economical access to market data and connectivity solutions that are right-sized according to their individual latency and business requirements.
